data: results of small data set, where brain region map probability threshold is 25%

data2: results of big data set (56 controls, 48 patients), where brain region map probability threshold is 50% 

data3: as in data2 but threshold graphs, th=0.2

data4: as in data2 but threshold graphs, th=0.4

data5:as in data2 but richclub graphs
