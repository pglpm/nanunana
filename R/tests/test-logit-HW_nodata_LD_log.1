Performing initial checks...
Suggestion: 4 possible instance(s) of for loops
     were found in the Model specification. Iteration speed will
     increase if for loops are vectorized in R or coded in a
     faster language such as C++ via the Rcpp package.
Algorithm: Automated Factor Slice Sampler 

Laplace's Demon is beginning to update...

Eigendecomposition will occur every 450 iterations.
