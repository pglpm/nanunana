<h2>Juxtapose MCMC Algorithm Inefficiency</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>


<p>This function gives a side-by-side comparison of (or juxtaposes) the
inefficiency of MCMC algorithms in <code><a href="../../LaplacesDemon/html/LaplacesDemon.html">LaplacesDemon</a></code> for
applied use, and is a valuable tool for selecting what is likely to be
the least inefficient algorithm for the user's current model, prior to
updating the final, intended model.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>This is a list of multiple components. Each component must
be an object of class <code>demonoid</code>.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>


<p>Laplace's Demon recommends using the <code>Juxtapose</code> function on the
user's model (or most likely a simplified version of it) with a
smaller, simulated data set to select the least inefficient MCMC
algorithm before using real data and updating the model for numerous
iterations. The least inefficient MCMC algorithm differs for different
models and data sets. Using <code>Juxtapose</code> in this way does not
guarantee that the selected algorithm will remain the best choice with
real data, but it should be better than otherwise selecting an
algorithm.
</p>
<p>The user must make a decision regarding their model and data. The more
similar the model and data is to the final, intended model and data,
the more appropriate will be the results of the <code>Juxtapose</code>
function. However, if the full model and data are used, then the user
may as well instead skip using <code>Juxtapose</code> and proceed directly
to <code><a href="../../LaplacesDemon/html/LaplacesDemon.html">LaplacesDemon</a></code>. Replacing the actual data set with a
smaller, simulated set is fairly straightforward, but the
decision-making will most likely focus on what is the best way to
reduce the full model specification. A simple approach may be to
merely reduce the number of predictors. However, complicated models
may have several components that slow down estimation time, and extend
the amount of time until global stationarity is estimated. Laplace's
Demon offers no guidance here, and leaves it in the realm of user
discretion.
</p>
<p>First, the user should simulate a smaller data set, and if best,
reduce the model specification. Next, the user must select candidate
algorithms. Then, the user must update each algorithm with
<code><a href="../../LaplacesDemon/html/LaplacesDemon.html">LaplacesDemon</a></code> for numerous iterations, with the goal of
achieving stationarity for all parameters early in the
iterations. Each update should begin with the same model specification
function, vector of initial values, and data. Each output object of
class <code>demonoid</code> should be renamed. An example follows.
</p>
<p>Suppose a user considers three candidate algorithms for their model:
AMWG, NUTS, and twalk. The user updates each model, saving the model
that used the AMWG algorithm as, say, <code>Fit1</code>, the NUTS model as
<code>Fit2</code>, and the twalk model as <code>Fit3</code>.
</p>
<p>Next, the output model objects are put in a list and passed to the
<code>Juxtapose</code> function. See the example below.
</p>
<p>The <code>Juxtapose</code> function uses an internal version of the
<code><a href="../../LaplacesDemon/html/IAT.html">IAT</a></code>, which is a slightly modified version of that found
in the <code>SamplerCompare</code> package. The <code>Juxtapose</code> function
returns an object of class <code>juxtapose</code>. It is a matrix in which
each row is a result and each column is an algorithm.
</p>
<p>The rows are:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>iter.min</code>: This is the iterations per minute.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>t.iter.min</code>: This is the thinned iterations per minute.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>prop.stat</code>: This is the proportion of iterations that
were stationary.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>IAT.025</code>: This is the 2.5% quantile of the integrated
autocorrelation time of the worst parameter, estimated only on
samples when all parameters are estimated to be globally stationary.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>IAT.500</code>: This is the median integrated autocorrelation
time of the worst parameter, estimated only on samples when all
parameters are estimated to be globally stationary.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>IAT.975</code>: This is the 97.5% quantile of the integrated
autocorrelation time of the worst parameter, estimated only on
samples when all parameters are estimated to be globally stationary.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>ISM.025</code>: This is the 2.5% quantile of the number of
independent samples per minute.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>ISM.500</code>: This is the median of the number of the
independent samples per minute. The least inefficient MCMC algorithm
has the highest <code>ISM.500</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>ISM.975</code>: This is the 97.5% quantile of the number of
the independent samples per minute.
</p>
</li></ul>

<p>As for calculating <i>ISM</i>, let <i>TIM</i> be the observed number of
thinned iterations per minute, <i>PS</i> be the percent of iterations
in which all parameters were estimated to be globally stationary, and
<i>IAT[q]</i> be a quantile from a simulated distribution of the
integrated autocorrelation time among the parameters.
</p>
<p align="center"><i>ISM = (PS x TIM) / IAT[q]</i></p>

<p>There are various ways to measure the inefficiency of MCMC
samplers. <code><a href="../../LaplacesDemon/html/IAT.html">IAT</a></code> is used perhaps most often. As with the
<code>SamplerCompare</code> package, Laplace's Demon uses the worst
parameter, in terms of <code><a href="../../LaplacesDemon/html/IAT.html">IAT</a></code>. Often, the number of
evaluations or number of parameters is considered. The
<code>Juxtapose</code> function, instead considers the final criterion of
MCMC efficiency, in an applied context, to be <code>ISM</code>, or the
number of Independent (thinned) Samples per Minute. The algorithm with
the highest <code>ISM.500</code> is the best, or least inefficient,
algorithm with respect to its worst <code><a href="../../LaplacesDemon/html/IAT.html">IAT</a></code>, the proportion
of iterations required to seem to have global stationarity, and the
number of (thinned) iterations per minute.
</p>
<p>A disadvantage of using time is that it will differ by computer, and
is less likely to be reported in a journal. The advantage, though, is
that it is more meaningful to a user. Increases in the number of
evaluations, parameters, and time should all correlate well, but time
may enlighten a user as to expected run-time given the model just
studied, even though the real data set will most likely be larger than
the simulated data used initially. NUTS is an example of a sampler in
which the number of evaluations varies per iteration. For an
alternative approach, see Thompson (2010).
</p>
<p>The <code>Juxtapose</code> function also adjusts <code>ISM</code> by
<code>prop.stat</code>, the proportion of the iterations in which all chains
were estimated to be stationary. This adjustment is weighted by
burn-in iterations, penalizing an algorithm that took longer to
achieve global stationarity. The goal, again, is to assist the user in
selecting the least inefficient MCMC algorithm in an applied setting.
</p>
<p>The <code>Juxtapose</code> function has many other potential uses than those
described above. One additional use of the <code>Juxtapose</code> function is
to compare inefficiencies within a single algorithm in which
algorithmic specifications varied with different model
updates. Another use is to investigate parallel chains in an object of
class <code>demonoid.hpc</code>, as returned from the
<code><a href="../../LaplacesDemon/html/LaplacesDemon.hpc.html">LaplacesDemon.hpc</a></code> function. Yet another use is to
compare the effects of small changes to a model specification
function, such as with priors, or due to an increase in the amount of
simulated data.
</p>
<p>An object of class <code>juxtapose</code> may be plotted with the
<code><a href="../../LaplacesDemon/html/plot.juxtapose.html">plot.juxtapose</a></code> function, which displays <code>ISM</code> by
default, or optionally <code>IAT</code>. For more information, see the
<code><a href="../../LaplacesDemon/html/plot.juxtapose.html">plot.juxtapose</a></code> function.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>


<p>This function returns an object of class <code>juxtapose</code>. It is a
<i>9 x J</i> matrix with nine results for <i>J</i> MCMC
algorithms.
