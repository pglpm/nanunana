<h2>Bayes' Theorem</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>


<p>Bayes' theorem shows the relation between two conditional
probabilities that are the reverse of each other. This theorem is
named after Reverend Thomas Bayes (1702-1761), and is also referred to
as Bayes' law or Bayes' rule (Bayes and Price, 1763). Bayes' theorem
expresses the conditional probability, or &lsquo;posterior probability&rsquo;, of
an event <i>A</i> after <i>B</i> is observed in terms of the 'prior
probability' of <i>A</i>, prior probability of <i>B</i>, and the
conditional probability of <i>B</i> given <i>A</i>. Bayes' theorem is
valid in all common interpretations of probability. This function
provides one of several forms of calculations that are possible with
Bayes' theorem.

<h3>Details</h3>


<p>Bayes' theorem provides an expression for the conditional probability
of <i>A</i> given <i>B</i>, which is equal to
</p>
<p align="center"><i>Pr(A | B) = (Pr(B
    | A)Pr(A)) / Pr(B)</i></p>

<p>For example, suppose one asks the question: what is the probability of
going to Hell, conditional on consorting (or given that a person
consorts) with Laplace's Demon. By replacing <i>A</i> with <i>Hell</i>
and <i>B</i> with <i>Consort</i>, the question becomes
</p>
<p align="center"><i>Pr(Hell |
  Consort) = (Pr(Consort | Hell)Pr(Hell)) / Pr(Consort)</i></p>

<p>Note that a common fallacy is to assume that <i>Pr(A | B) = Pr(B | A)</i>, which is called the conditional
probability fallacy.
</p>
<p>Another way to state Bayes' theorem (and this is the form in the
provided function) is
</p>
<p align="center"><i>Pr(A[i] | B) = (Pr(B | A[i])Pr(A[i])) /
  (Pr(B | A[i])Pr(A[i]) +...+ Pr(B | A[n])Pr(A[n]))</i></p>

<p>Let's examine our <EM>burning</EM> question, by replacing
<i>A[i]</i> with Hell or Heaven, and replacing <i>B</i> with
Consort
</p>

<ul>
<li> <i>Pr(A[1] = Pr(Hell)</i>
</li>
<li> <i>Pr(A[2] = Pr(Heaven)</i>
</li>
<li> <i>Pr(B) = Pr(Consort)</i>
</li>
<li> <i>Pr(A[1] | B) = Pr(Hell | Consort)</i>
</li>
<li> <i>Pr(A[2] | B) = Pr(Heaven | Consort)</i>
</li>
<li> <i>Pr(B | A[1]) = Pr(Consort | Heaven)</i>
</li>
<li> <i>Pr(B | A[2]) = Pr(Consort | Heaven)</i>
</li></ul>

<p>Laplace's Demon was conjured and asked for some data. He was glad to
oblige.
</p>

<ul>
<li><p> 6 people consorted out of 9 who went to Hell.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> 5 people consorted out of 7 who went to Heaven.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> 75% of the population goes to Hell.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> 25% of the population goes to Heaven.
</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Now, Bayes' theorem is applied to the data. Four pieces are worked out
as follows
</p>

<ul>
<li> <i>Pr(Consort | Hell) = 6/9 = 0.666</i>
</li>
<li> <i>Pr(Consort | Heaven) = 5/7 = 0.714</i>
</li>
<li> <i>Pr(Hell) = 0.75</i>
</li>
<li> <i>Pr(Heaven) = 0.25</i>
</li></ul>

<p>Finally, the desired conditional probability <i>Pr(Hell | Consort)</i> is calculated using Bayes'
theorem
</p>

<ul>
<li> <i>Pr(Hell | Consort) =
    0.666(0.75) / (0.666(0.75) + 0.714(0.25))</i>
</li>
<li> <i>Pr(Hell |
    Consort) = 0.737</i>
</li></ul>

<p>The probability of someone consorting with Laplace's Demon and going
to Hell is 73.7%, which is less than the prevalence of 75% in the
population. According to these findings, consorting with Laplace's
Demon does not increase the probability of going to Hell.

<h3>Value</h3>


<p>The <code>BayesTheorem</code> function returns the conditional probability
of <i>A</i> given <i>B</i>, known in Bayesian inference as the
posterior. The returned object is of class <code>bayestheorem</code>.
