<h2>de Finetti's Game</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>


<p>The <code>de.Finetti.Game</code> function estimates the interval of a
subjective probability regarding a possible event in the near future.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
de.Finetti.Game(width)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>


<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>width</code></td>
<td>
<p>This is the maximum acceptable width of the interval for
the returned subjective probability. The user must specify a width
between 0 and 1.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>


<p>This function is a variation on the game introduced by de Finetti,
who is one of the main developers of subjective probability,
along with Ramsey and Savage. In the original context, de Finetti
proposed a gamble regarding life on Mars one billion years ago.
</p>
<p>The frequentist interpretation of probability defines the probability
of an event as the limit of its relative frequency in a large number
of trials. Frequentist inference is undefined, for example, when there
are no trials from which to calculate a probability. By defining
probability relative to frequencies of physical events, frequentists
attempt to objectify probability. However, de Finetti asserts that the
frequentist (or objective) interpretation always reduces to a subjective
interpretation of probability, because probability is a human
construct and does not exist independently of humans in
nature. Therefore, probability is a degree of belief, and is called
subjective or personal probability.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>


<p>The <code>de.Finetti.Game</code> function returns a vector of length
two. The respective elements are the lower and upper bounds of the
subjective probability of the participant regarding the possible event
in the near future.
