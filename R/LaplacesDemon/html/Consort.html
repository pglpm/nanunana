<h2>Consort with Laplace's Demon</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>


<p>This may be used to consort with Laplace's Demon regarding an object
of class <code>demonoid</code>. Laplace's Demon will offer suggestions.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>Consort(object)</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>


<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>object</code></td>
<td>
<p>This required argument is an object of class
<code>demonoid</code>.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>


<p>First, <code>Consort</code> calls <code>print.demonoid</code>, which prints most
of the components to the screen from the supplied object of class
<code>demonoid</code>.
</p>
<p>Second, Laplace's Demon considers a combination of five conditions
when making the largest part of its suggestion. These conditions are:
the algorithm, acceptance rate, MCSE, ESS, and stationarity. Other
things are considered as well, such as the recommended thinning value
is used to suggest a new number of iterations, how fast the algorithm
is expected to be, and if the condition of diminishing adaptation was
met (for an adaptive algorithm). Diminishing adaptation occurs only
when the absolute value of the proposed variances trends downward
(toward zero) over the course of all adaptations. When an algorithm is
adaptive and it does not have diminishing adaptations, the
<code>Consort</code> function will suggest a different adaptive algorithm.
The <code>Periodicity</code> argument is suggested to be set equal to the
value of <code>Rec.Thinning</code>.
</p>
<p>Appeasement Conditions
</p>

<ul>
<li><p> Algorithm: The final algorithm must be non-adaptive, so that the
Markov property holds.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Acceptance Rate: The acceptance rate is considered satisfactory
if it is within the interval [15%,50%].
</p>
</li>
<li><p> MCSE: The Monte Carlo Standard Error (MCSE) is considered
satisfactory for each target distribution if it is less than 6.27%
of the standard deviation of the target distribution. This allows
the true mean to be within 5% of the area under a Gaussian
distribution around the estimated mean. The <code><a href="../../LaplacesDemon/html/MCSE.html">MCSE</a></code>
function is used. The criterion of 6.27% for this stopping rule is
arbitary, and may be too lenient or strict, depending on the needs of
the user. Nonetheless, it has performed well, and this type of
stopping rule has been observed to perform better than MCMC
convergence diagnostics (Flegal et al., 2008).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> ESS: The effective sample size (ESS) is considered satisfactory
for each target distribution if it is at least 100, which is usually
enough to describe 95% probability intervals (see
<code><a href="../../LaplacesDemon/html/p.interval.html">p.interval</a></code> and <code><a href="../../LaplacesDemon/html/LPL.interval.html">LPL.interval</a></code> for more
information). The <code><a href="../../LaplacesDemon/html/ESS.html">ESS</a></code> function is used.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Stationarity: Each target distribution is considered
satisfactory if it is estimated to be stationary with the
<code><a href="../../LaplacesDemon/html/Geweke.Diagnostic.html">Geweke.Diagnostic</a></code> function.
</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Bear in mind that the MCSE, ESS, and Stationarity criteria are all
univariate measures applied to each marginal posterior
distribution. Multivariate forms are not included. By chance alone due
to multiple independent tests, 5% of these diagnostics should
indicate non-convergence when 'convergence' exists. In contrast, even
one non-convergent nuisance parameter is associated with
non-convergence in all other parameters. Assessing convergence is
difficult.
</p>
<p>If all five conditions are satisfactory, then Laplace's Demon is
appeased. Otherwise, Laplace's Demon will suggest and supply R
code that is ready to be copy/pasted and executed.
</p>
<p>To visualize the MCSE-based stopping rule, run the following code:
</p>
<p><code>x &lt;- seq(from=-3, to=3, by=0.1);</code>
<code>plot(x, dnorm(x,0,1), type="l");</code>
<code>abline(v=-0.0627); abline(v=0.0627);</code>
<code>abline(v=2*-0.0627, col="red"); abline(v=2*0.0627, col="red")</code>
</p>
<p>The black vertical lines show the standard error, and the red vertical
lines show the 95% interval.
</p>
<p>If the user has an object of class <code>demonoid.hpc</code>, the
<code>Consort</code> function may be still be applied, but a particular
chain in the object must be specified as a component in a list. For
example, with an object called <code>Fit</code> and a goal of consorting
over the second chain, the code would be: <code>Consort(Fit[[2]])</code>.
</p>
<p>The Demonic Suggestion is usually very helpful, but should not be
followed blindly. Do not let it replace critical thinking. For
example, <code>Consort</code> may find that diminishing adaptation is unmet,
and recommend a different algorithm. However, the user may be
convinced that the current algorithm is best, and believe instead that
MCMC found a local solution, and is leaving it to find the global
solution, in which case adaptations may increase again. If this is
true, then it may be best to ignore the newly suggested algorithm, and
continue with the current algorithm. The suggested code may be
helpful, but it is merely a suggestion.
