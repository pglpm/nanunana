-- NOTES FOR THE APPROACH IN THE NON-PARAMETRIC VERSION --

The clinician needs the *likelihood of the health condition*, that is, *the
probability of the test result given the health condition*, for two
reasons:

1. in order to combine the evidence from several tests - whose number and
availability can be different from patient to patient - and the prior guess,

2. in order to make a treatment decision based on a utility function, which
can be different from patient to patient.


We want an algorithm that gives us such health-likelihood and that learns
from previously analysed and verified cases. This last requirement means
that some "state" in the algorithm must be updated and saved from case to
case. This state allows us to calculate the updated probability of the test
result (health-likelihood).
